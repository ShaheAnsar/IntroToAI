Bot 2:
- it can NOT handle aliens. It absolutely sucks when an alien is detected nearby. 
    I didn't check how bot 1 handles it, but bot 2 is ass when it comes to this.
- i think the evasion also sucks, but let's see about that.

Bot 4:
- it just plain sucks, gotta check the math on this one

Every other bot:
- we gotta add aliens (which is basically done) and fix the evasion
